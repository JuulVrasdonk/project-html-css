                <p>We starting strong to kick this legendary  eleven off. Our goalkeeper is Victor Vald&eacute;s, who born in a vilage near Barcelona city. Louis van Gaal got him to join the Barcelona team in 2002. First he was a substitute goalkeeper. But when Rijkaard became headcoach he started to become the starting eleven goalkeeper. Victor Valdes was a great goalkeeper from that season on. Till 2014 when he joined Manchester United. Victor isn't active as a proffesional anymore. But he became a legend for sure with his performances for our club.</p>

                <p>On the right back position we chose to go with a legendary brazilian. Dani Alves makes in to our eleven because of the prices he won wearin the Blaugrana shirt. His nickname <em>&#34;roadrunner&#34;</em> says enough about his style a play. You could always find him on the right hand side. Some games his condition seamed to be endless.

                <h2 class="cardhead">Carles Puyol</h2>
               <p>When most Barcelona fans think about a true leader they think of Carles Puyol. Known for his leading ability, he led Barcelona nummerous league titles and most important winning the Champions League 3 times. Puyol was also a world class defender. Carles Puyol  gave more  than his all every game. Sometimes paired with headinjury&apos;s. But that didn't really bother Carles. The one thing he about was not getting scored against and getting the ball to the midfield to start an attack. </p>

                <h2 class="cardhead">&Eacute;ric Abidal</h2>
                <p>Eric Abidal most definitely had the toughest career of this eleven. Eric suffered cancer two times in his career at Barcelona. During his illnes he set a goal for himself.

                <p>Xavi Hern&aacute;ndez joined <dfn title=" FC Barcelona youth academy">La masia</dfn> in the 1991. Xavi has a kind of similar story to Iniesta his one. They both joined the club when they were around 10 years old. And both became club icons. After Puyol retired Xavi became captain of the first team. He was a great captain because of his philosophy about football. Pep Guardiola was head coach at the time and they shared the philosophy. Which gave Barca many trophies.
