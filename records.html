                <h2 class="facthead"> <span>1.</span>Most points in a La Liga season.</h2>
                <p class="facttext">The 2012-2013 season was one to never forget. With players like Messi, Xavi and Iniesta playing to the best of their ability, wasn't it about if they were going to win the league but by how many points. The big star that was Lionel Messi who was top scorer of the league with an insane amount of 46 league goals.</p>

                <h2 class="facthead"><span>2.</span>Unbeatable</h2>
                <p class="facttext">The second record on this list was created in two seasons. Because the unbeaten streak of FC Barcelona included 43 games. Big part of this amazing was played by the front three Messi, Neymar and Suarez. The streak ended tragicly against 15th place Levante in the 2017-2018. </p>

                <h2 class="facthead"><span>3.</span>Best player awards</h2>
                <p class="facttext">You have already seen his name a couple of times on this page. But that is simply because he is greatest player ever. Lionel Messi has won 6<strong>Best FIFA Men's Player</strong> awards. Where Cristiano Ronaldo was on the same level as Messi with 5 awards on his name for a long time. Lionel took record for himself in the autumn of 2019, when he won his 6th award</p>

                <h2 class="facthead"><span>4.</span>Best goal difference</h2>
                <p class="facttext">This record is all about team chemistry. The Barcelona team of the 2014-2015 season got a goal difference +89 goals at the end of the season. Which means they had to score 2.3 goal every game without conceding a single goal all season to get this record. This record is as much a defence record as it's an attacking one.</p>

                <h2 class="facthead"><span>5.</span>Most appearances</h2>
               <p class="facttext">The last record in this list goes to one of our greatest legends of the club. His name is Xavi and with an insane amount of 767 appearances made him the player who's been on the pitch for the longest time for our club. But Xavi could lose in his number one spot in the upcoming years. Because Lionel Messi is on a total 694 appearances for the club. And he some years to play still...</p>
